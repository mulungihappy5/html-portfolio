<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My biggest strength is being able to quickly and easily see skills, gifts and talents that people don't even realize they have. My greatest satisfaction comes from helping individuals discover and develop these skills, and seeing them set sail with enthusiasm and confidence toward a future filled with joy, satisfaction, and success beyond their wildest dreams.</p>

<p>I help people explore their past so they can create their future. Whether I am writing weekly column or peaking to audiences about turning  tragedies into triumphs, or guiding individuals through their own journey of discovery, my goal is always the same: to help you find your buried treasure so you can make the rest of your life the best of your life.</p>
